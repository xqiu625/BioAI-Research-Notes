I'll break down the key computational design workflow used in this paper:

1. Initial Target Site Selection
```
Target: TLR3 ectodomain (PDB ID: 1ZIW)
Selected Sites:
- Site A: LRR 19-22 (residues Ile510, Ile534, Ile566, Ile590)
- Site B: LRR 9-11 (residues Leu243, Leu269, Trp273, Trp296)
```

2. RifDock Pipeline Components
```python
# Core steps in design pipeline:

1. RifGen:
   - Dock disembodied amino acid side chains against Sites A & B
   - Generate interaction fragments

2. PatchDock:
   - Parallel docking of 21,402 pre-existing protein backbones
   - Target: 3-helix bundles
   - Generate initial poses

3. RifDock:
   - Match high-scoring disembodied sidechains
   - Output promising docks

4. FastDesign:
   - Generate designed amino acid sequences
   - Optimize protein-protein interface

5. MotifGraft:
   - Extract best-scoring interfaces
   - Second round of FastDesign optimization
```

3. Design Filtering Metrics
```python
# Key computational filters:
filters = {
    "ddG": "Predicted binding energy",
    "contact_molecular_surface": "Surface area to hydrophobic residues",
    "SAP": "Spatial aggregation propensity"
}

# Result: 23,789 designs selected
# Distribution:
- Site A: 48%
- Site B: 52%
```

4. Affinity Maturation Pipeline
```python
# Site Saturation Mutagenesis (SSM)
for minibinder in successful_hits:
    # Create library with all 20 amino acids at each position
    ssm_library = generate_mutations(minibinder)
    
    # Deep sequencing analysis
    enrichment_scores = analyze_sorting_data(ssm_library)
    
    # Generate heatmaps
    plot_mutation_effects(enrichment_scores)

# Combinatorial Libraries
selected_mutations = identify_beneficial_mutations(ssm_data)
combinatorial_library = combine_mutations(selected_mutations)
```

5. Structure Prediction & Validation
```python
# Compare experimental vs predicted structures
validation = {
    "AlphaFold2": "Used for structure prediction",
    "Cryo-EM": "Experimental validation at 2.9Ã…",
    "RMSD comparison": {
        "minibinder_7.7": "1.0Ã…",
        "minibinder_8.6": "2.0Ã…"
    }
}
```

Key Implementation Details:
1. Computational Resources:
- Required significant computational power for design generation
- Parallel processing for docking simulations
- Deep sequencing analysis pipeline

2. Software Dependencies:
```python
required_software = [
    "Rosetta Suite",
    "RifGen",
    "PatchDock",
    "FastDesign",
    "MotifGraft",
    "AlphaFold2"
]
```

3. Critical Parameters:
```python
design_parameters = {
    "backbone_sampling": "3-helix bundles",
    "interface_size": "optimal for stability",
    "hydrophobic_patch_targeting": "key for binding",
    "glycan_consideration": "critical for success"
}
```

4. Quality Control:
```python
quality_checks = [
    "Interface energy evaluation",
    "Structural stability prediction",
    "Glycan clash checking",
    "Binding mode verification"
]
```

The success of this workflow relied heavily on:
- Careful selection of target sites
- Robust filtering of designs
- Iterative improvement through SSM
- Integration of experimental feedback
- Consideration of glycosylation effects

This computational approach successfully generated minibinders with nanomolar affinities and desired biological activity, demonstrating the power of computational protein design for creating novel protein-based therapeutics.
