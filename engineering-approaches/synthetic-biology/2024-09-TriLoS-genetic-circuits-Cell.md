## ðŸ’¡ Personal Notes
A. TriLoS (tristate-based logic synthesis) :

   Main Focus:
      1. Engineering Gene Networks
      - Uses tristate buffers as basic signal processing units instead of conventional logic gates
      - Creates multi-layered gene networks for complex computations
      - Enables resource-efficient design through programmable gene expression

      2. Core Technical Innovation:
      - Transforms Boolean logic algorithms into modular genetic circuits
      - Uses upstream switches to directly control downstream switches
      - Employs a "high-impedance" state (Z) to reduce interference and background activity
   
   Key Goals:
   
      1. Overcome Current Limitations:
      - Reduce signal processing delays in genetic circuits
      - Minimize interference between genetic components
      - Enable more complex multi-layered gene networks
      - Simplify design of sophisticated cellular computations

      2. Enable Practical Applications:
      - Create programmable cell-based therapies
      - Allow user-defined control of therapeutic protein secretion
      - Enable disease-specific treatment logics
      - Facilitate precise cellular control

      3. Technical Implementation:
      - Map various logic algorithms into genetic circuits
      - Create standardized design principles for gene networks
      - Enable flexible combination of genetic components
      - Achieve robust and specific cellular responses

B. Diabetes therapeutic example from the paper:

      1. Therapeutic Framework Design
      ```
      Input Signals:
      - VA (Vanillic Acid) - Control for GLP-1 production
      - Gra (Grazoprevir) - Control for Insulin production  
      - Tam (Tamoxifen) - Control for GLP-1 module inactivation

      Output Proteins:
      - Insulin (INS) 
      - Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)
      ```

      2. Treatment Logic:
         - For T2D (Type 2 Diabetes):
           - VA triggers GLP-1 secretion
           - Gra triggers insulin secretion
           - Can control each protein independently or together

         - For T1D/late-stage T2D:
           - Tamoxifen permanently inactivates GLP-1 module
           - Only insulin production remains active
           - Controlled by Grazoprevir

      3. Implementation:
      ```
      Genetic Circuit Components:
      1. BUF circuits for insulin control
         - Gra-regulated insulin expression (INS = B)

      2. Complex circuits for GLP-1 control
         - VA-regulated GLP-1 expression (GLP-1 = AC)
         - Tamoxifen-dependent inactivation

      Cell Engineering:
      - Microencapsulated cells in alginate beads
      - Immunoprotective coating
      - Injectable therapeutic units
      ```

      4. Validation & Results:

         Mouse Models Used:
         - Wild-type (WT) - healthy controls
         - db/db mice - T2D model
         - STZ mice - T1D model

         Key Results:
         - T2D Model:
         - VA or Gra reduced fasting glycemia
         - GLP-1 and insulin secretion matched designed logic
         - Demonstrated independent control of both proteins

         - T1D Model:
         - After tamoxifen treatment:
            - Only Gra-induced insulin remained active
            - VA no longer triggered GLP-1 production
            - Achieved glycemic control through insulin only

      5. Advantages of this System:
         - Programmable treatment logic
         - Patient-specific customization
         - Reversible or permanent therapeutic modes
         - Precise control over protein secretion
         - Single implant with multiple therapeutic options

      6. Technical Achievements:
         - First demonstration of 3-input 2-output therapeutic biocomputer
         - Successful translation of TriLoS to therapeutic application
         - Demonstrated long-term stability and specificity
         - Achieved clinically relevant protein levels

C. Genetic circuits:

   1. Basic Components:
      - Promoters: Like "ON/OFF switches" for genes
      - Genes: Instructions to make proteins
      - Regulatory Proteins: Control elements that turn genes on or off
      - RNA: The messenger carrying instructions

   2. Simple Example:
      ```
      Input Signal (e.g., drug) 
          â†“
      Promoter (switch)
          â†“
      Gene (instructions)
          â†“
      Protein (output)
      ```

      Just like how turning on a light switch completes an electrical circuit and lights up a bulb, adding a drug (input) can activate a promoter (switch) to make a protein (output).

   3. In this Paper's System:

      They created three types of controls:
      ```
      a) Vanillic Acid Control:
         Drug â†’ Promoter â†’ GLP-1 production

      b) Grazoprevir Control:
         Drug â†’ Promoter â†’ Insulin production

      c) Tamoxifen Control:
         Drug â†’ Permanent switch off of GLP-1 circuit
      ```

4. Multi-Layer System:
      Think of it like a domino effect:
      - First layer: Drug detection
      - Second layer: Gene activation
      - Third layer: Protein production

      What makes this special is the "tristate" part:
- ON state (1): Gene is active
      - OFF state (0): Gene is inactive
      - Disconnected state (Z): Gene circuit is completely unplugged

      Real-World Analogy:
      It's like having a smart home system where:
      - You can turn lights on (ON)
      - You can turn lights off (OFF)
      - You can completely disconnect certain rooms from the system (Z)

      The big innovation is making these genetic "smart home systems" work reliably inside cells to produce therapeutic proteins when needed.

   5. Practical Application:
      For diabetes treatment:
      ```
      Type 2 Diabetes:
      Input: Vanillic Acid â†’ Output: GLP-1
      Input: Grazoprevir â†’ Output: Insulin

      Type 1 Diabetes:
      First: Tamoxifen â†’ Turns off GLP-1 circuit
      Then: Grazoprevir â†’ Only controls Insulin
```
