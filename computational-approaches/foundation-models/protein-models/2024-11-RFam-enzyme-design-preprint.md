## ðŸŽ¯ Core Contributions
1. Development of RFam, a new generative AI method for enzyme design that can sample sequence positions and sidechain conformations
2. Creation of highly active metallohydrolases without requiring experimental optimization
3. Achievement of kcat/KM of 23,000 M-1 s-1, orders of magnitude higher than previous designs

## ðŸ“‹ Paper Structure

### 1. Introduction
- Background: Metallohydrolases catalyze difficult hydrolysis reactions using metal ions
- Problem: Current enzyme design methods require explicit specification of sequence positions and backbone coordinates
