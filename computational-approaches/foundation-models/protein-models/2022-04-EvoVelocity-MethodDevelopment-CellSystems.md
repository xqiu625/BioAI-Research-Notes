## ðŸ”„ Key Scientific Insights
### 1. Conceptual Innovation
- Introduces "evolutionary velocity" (evo-velocity) - a method using protein language models to predict evolutionary trajectories
- Shows a single language model can predict evolution across diverse proteins and timescales
- Demonstrates that local sequence predictions can reconstruct global evolutionary patterns
- Provides insights into viral immune escape, protein family evolution, and horizontal gene transfer

### 2. Methodological Framework
- Uses ESM-1b language model trained on 27M UniRef50 sequences
- Constructs sequence similarity networks and assigns directional scores
- Applies diffusion analysis to identify evolutionary roots and order sequences
- Validates across multiple protein families and evolutionary timescales

### 3. Core Validation Examples
- Viral proteins: Influenza NP/HA, HIV-1 Gag, SARS-CoV-2 Spike
- Ancient proteins: Globins, Cytochrome c
- Highly conserved proteins: Serpins, Enolase, PGK
