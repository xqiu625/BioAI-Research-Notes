### A. The Basic Architecture üèóÔ∏è
Think of PRIME like a smart protein-reading machine with three main parts:

1. **Main Brain (BERT-oriented transformer encoder)**:
   - This is like the central processing unit
   - It learns to understand protein sequences, kind of like how we understand sentences

2. **Two Special Modules**:
   - **MLM Module**: Like a word prediction game - it learns to guess missing amino acids
   - **OGT Module**: Predicts the optimal temperature where the protein works best

3. **Three Ways of Learning**:
   - **MLM Loss**: Measures how good it is at predicting amino acids
   - **OGT Loss**: Checks how accurate its temperature predictions are
   - **Correlation Loss**: Makes sure its predictions make sense together

### B. Temperature Prediction üå°Ô∏è
Imagine you have a new protein sequence:
- PRIME can predict what temperature this protein likes best
- It can learn from different types of temperature data
- Useful for finding proteins that work well at high temperatures

### C. Mutation Scoring üéØ
This is like spell-checking for proteins:
1. Takes a normal (wild-type) protein sequence
2. When you want to change one amino acid (mutation)
3. PRIME calculates whether this change is likely to be good or bad
4. Uses math (log-odds ratio) to give each mutation a score

### D. Making Multiple Changes üîÑ
This is like a step-by-step recipe:
1. First, try single changes and pick the best ones
2. Test these in the lab
3. Use these results to make PRIME even smarter
4. Then predict which combinations of changes might work best
5. Test the best combinations in the lab

Think of it like cooking:
- First, you try changing one ingredient at a time
- Learn what works
- Then try combining the successful changes
- Finally, test your best recipes
