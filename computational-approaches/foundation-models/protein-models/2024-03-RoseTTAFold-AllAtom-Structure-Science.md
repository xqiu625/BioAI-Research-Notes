## 💡 Personal Notes
### A.Explain Three-track architecture mixing 1D, 2D, and 3D information
#### 1. 1D Track (Sequence Track)
- **Input**: Chemical element types of non-polymer atoms
- **Representation**: Linear sequence information 
- **Features**:
  ```
  - Encodes 20 residues + 8 nucleic acid bases
  - 46 new element type tokens for common elements in PDB
  - Encodes bond information (single, double, triple, aromatic)
  - Includes chirality information (R or S)
  ```

#### 2. 2D Track (Pairwise Track)
- **Purpose**: Captures relationships between pairs of elements
- **Features**:
  ```
  - Bond information between atom pairs
  - Pairwise distances
  - Atom bond embeddings 
  - Initial pair features at start of each recycle
  - Helps model learn about bond lengths, angles, planarity
  ```

#### 3. 3D Track (Structure Track)
- **Purpose**: Generates 3D coordinates and spatial relationships
- **Features**:
  ```
  - Updates frame orientation and translational updates
  - Predicts coordinate frames
  - Computes gradient of deviation from ideal angles
  - Makes structure predictions invariant to reflections
  - Encodes stereochemistry information
  ```

#### Simplified Analogy

Think of it like building a house:

| Track | Building Analogy | Language Learning Analogy |
|-------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 1D | Understanding individual building materials | Learning individual words |
| 2D | Knowing how materials connect | Understanding grammar rules |
| 3D | Assembling the complete structure | Having real conversations |

## Key Integration
- All tracks communicate bidirectionally
- Information flows between tracks during each cycle
- System maintains chemical constraints while predicting structures
- Enables simultaneous consideration of:
  1. Local chemical properties (1D)
  2. Pairwise interactions (2D)
  3. Global spatial arrangements (3D)

#### (通俗解释)
🔤 第一轨(1D序列轨道):
- 就像读一本书一样,从头到尾一个字一个字地读
- 主要记录每个原子的基本信息:
  - 是什么类型的原子(碳、氮、氧等)
  - 化学键的类型(单键、双键等)
  - 原子的手性(左手还是右手结构)
- 就像认识每个"字"的基本特征

🔄 第二轨(2D配对轨道):
- 类似于观察文字之间的关系
- 记录任意两个原子之间的:
  - 距离有多远
  - 是否有化学键连接
  - 键的类型是什么
- 就像理解"词"与"词"之间的关系

🎯 第三轨(3D结构轨道):
- 负责预测分子的实际3D形状
- 确保预测的结构:
  - 键长合理
  - 键角正确
  - 整体构象稳定
- 就像把"平面的文字"变成"立体的模型"

🔗 三轨道协同工作:
- 打个比方:就像盖房子
  - 第一轨: 认识建材(砖、瓦、木材)
  - 第二轨: 知道哪些建材要接在一起
  - 第三轨: 最终建成完整的房子

### B. RFAA uses 46 new element type tokens from analyzing the PDB 
### Composition Breakdown
```
Base Elements: 
- 20 amino acid residues (protein building blocks)
- 4 DNA bases
- 4 RNA bases
Plus:
- Most common element types in PDB entries
  * Metals (Fe, Zn, Ca, etc.)
  * Common organic elements (C, N, O, H, S, P)
  * Halogens (Cl, F, Br, I)
  * Others found in small molecules and modifications
```

### Technical Implementation
The model uses these tokens to:
1. Encode non-protein components in biomolecular assemblies
2. Represent chemical elements at atomic level
3. Enable modeling of diverse molecular structures
