## ðŸ’¡ Personal Notes
A. evaluation workflow for assessing predictions
  1. Inference and Sampling
    - Generate 25 samples using 5 model seeds
    - Export each sample in two formats:
      * CIF file for structure
      * JSON file containing confidence ranking scores
  - Use different prediction targets based on dataset:
      * PoseBusters V2: predict asymmetric unit
      * Other datasets: predict first bioassembly
  - Apply 10 recycles generally (matches AF3's configuration)

  2. Chain and Atom Permutation
    - Perform chain mapping to establish one-to-one correspondence between:
      * Predicted entities
      * True entities
    - After identifying equivalent chains:
      * Permute the chains
      * Permute the atoms
      * Align prediction with true structure

  3. Metrics Computation
    - Use specific methods for different interaction types:
        * For proteins: DockQ Python package for DockQ scores
        * For PoseBusters V2 predictions:
          a. Export structures:
               - Ligand of interest â†’ SDF file
               - Chains within 5Ã… of predicted ligand â†’ PDB file
          b. Analysis:
               - Use PoseBusters Python package v.0.2.7
               - Calculate ligand RMSD
               - Evaluate structural violations
