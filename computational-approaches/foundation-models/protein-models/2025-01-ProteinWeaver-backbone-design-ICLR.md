## ðŸ”„ Key Scientific Insights
### 1. Conceptual Innovation
- Introduces a novel "divide-and-assembly" approach for protein backbone design
- Mimics nature's strategy of creating complex proteins through domain recombination
- Addresses the limitation of decreasing designability in long-chain proteins

### 2. Methodological Framework
- Two-stage framework:
  1. Domain generation: Divides sequence into multiple domains and generates them independently
  2. Flexible assembly: Uses SE(3) diffusion model to assemble domains with optimal interactions
- Employs preference alignment to navigate complex domain interaction landscapes

### 3. Validation Strategy
- Comprehensive evaluation across different protein lengths (100-800 residues)
- Comparison with state-of-the-art methods
- Case studies in functional design applications

## ðŸ”¬ Critical Technical Details
### 1. Model Architecture
- Uses SE(3) diffusion model for domain assembly
- Incorporates spliced distance maps for domain interaction modeling
- Implements preference alignment through SPPO for optimization

### 2. Key Components
- Domain division strategy
- Flexible assembly with 15-residue linkers between domains
- Preference alignment for optimizing inter-domain interactions

### 3. Performance Metrics
- Outperforms RFdiffusion by 13% and 39% for long-chain proteins
- Achieves high interface quality scores (interface scTM)
- Maintains structural quality while increasing novelty

## ðŸ’­ Critical Research Implications
### 1. Methodological Impact
