# 🔬 **Scientific Contributions**

## 1. **Cell2Sentence-Scale (C2S-Scale) Framework**
- Scales up the original Cell2Sentence (C2S) to use large language models (LLMs) for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis.
- Core innovation: **“Cell sentences”** – gene names ordered by expression level, forming textual representations of single cells.
- Enables LLMs (up to 27B parameters) to model biological data without architectural modification.

## 2. **Multimodal and Scalable Modeling**
- Trained on **150 million samples** from over **50 million human and mouse cells**, plus biological texts and metadata.
- Supports **context length up to 8192 tokens** for multi-cell input.
- Demonstrates **scaling laws**: larger models (410M → 27B) consistently improve performance, in both full and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

# ⚙️ **Technical Innovations**

## A. **Model Architecture**
- Uses **Gemma-2** and **Pythia** architectures with sizes from 410M to 27B.
- Applies to diverse tasks using **natural language prompts**.

## B. **Single-Cell Fréchet Inception Distance (scFID)**
A biologically meaningful metric for evaluating generative models in single-cell analysis.
### How It Works:
- Inspired by **FID** in image generation:
  - Measures distribution similarity between real and generated data.
- scFID formula:
  \[
  \text{scFID} = ||\mu_r - \mu_g||^2 + \text{Tr}(\Sigma_r + \Sigma_g - 2(\Sigma_r \Sigma_g)^{1/2})
  \]
  where \(\mu\) and \(\Sigma\) are means and covariances of embedded representations.

### Advantages:
- Uses **foundation model embeddings** instead of raw gene expression.
- **Robust to noise**, better reflects **biological similarity**.

## C. **Reinforcement Learning with GRPO**
- Applies **Group Relative Policy Optimization** to improve:
  - Perturbation response prediction
  - Nonlinear gene program reasoning

# 🧠 **Biological Capabilities Enabled**

## 1. **Cell Type Annotation and Reasoning**
- Handles **annotation, tissue inference, cell interactions**, and **complex biological QA**.

## 2. **Conditioned Cell Generation**
- Generates cells based on user queries such as:
  - “CD8+ T cells from pancreas”
  - “7 human kidney cells”
- Allows **multi-cell and neighborhood generation**, supporting spatial reasoning.

## 3. **Perturbation Response Modeling**
- Predicts how cells respond to:
  - Drugs
  - Cytokines
  - Gene knockouts
- **Generalizes across unseen combinations** of cell types and perturbations.

# 🔁 **Comparison to Other scFMs (Single-Cell Foundation Models)**

| Feature | **C2S-Scale** | Other Models (scGPT, Geneformer, scFoundation) |
|--------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Data Representation** | Text (ordered gene names) | Expression matrix |
| **Architecture** | General LLMs (Gemma, Pythia) | Custom architectures |
| **Scale** | Up to 27B parameters | Typically ≤ 1B |
| **Multimodal Input** | Yes (text + expression + metadata) | Often limited |
| **Tasks Supported** | Multi-task incl. QA, generation | Usually single-task |
| **Language Interpretation** | Natural language interface | Limited / none |
| **Spatial Modeling** | Supports cell neighborhood context | Rarely supported |
| **RL Fine-tuning** | GRPO for specific tasks | Not used |

# 🧪 **Implementation Notes**

## A. **Cell Sentence Construction**
- Convert expression matrix → ordered gene names
- Preserves expression ranking with **minimal loss**
- Reversible: can map back to expression values

## B. **Training Tasks**
- Multi-task format using **natural language prompts**, such as:
  - “What tissue is this cell from?”
  - “Generate a fibroblast in lung after IL-6 stimulation.”

# 📈 **scFID vs. FID — Visual vs. Single-Cell Analogy**

| Concept | **FID (Image)** | **scFID (Single-Cell)** |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Data Type** | Images | Gene expression |
| **Embedding Source** | Inception-v3 | scGPT / Foundation model |
| **Goal** | Image realism | Biological fidelity |
| **Noise Robustness** | High | Very high |
| **Evaluation** | Visual realism | Functional relevance |

> 🔎 *scFID makes it possible to evaluate single-cell generation not just by expression statistics, but by biologically meaningful features.*
