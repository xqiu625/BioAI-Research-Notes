🔬 Scientific Contributions

1. Cell2Sentence-Scale (C2S-Scale) Framework
	•	Scales up the original Cell2Sentence (C2S) to use large language models (LLMs) for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis.
	•	Core innovation: “Cell sentences” – gene names ordered by expression level, forming textual representations of single cells.
	•	Enables LLMs (up to 27B parameters) to model biological data without architectural modification.

2. Multimodal and Scalable Modeling
	•	Trained on 150 million samples from over 50 million human and mouse cells, plus biological texts and metadata.
	•	Supports context length up to 8192 tokens for multi-cell input.
	•	Demonstrates scaling laws: larger models (410M → 27B) consistently improve performance, in both full and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

⚙️ Technical Innovations

A. Model Architecture
	•	Uses Gemma-2 and Pythia architectures with sizes from 410M to 27B.
	•	Applies to diverse tasks using natural language prompts.

B. Single-Cell Fréchet Inception Distance (scFID)

A biologically meaningful metric for evaluating generative models in single-cell analysis.

How It Works:
	•	Inspired by FID in image generation:
	•	Measures distribution similarity between real and generated data.
	•	scFID formula:
\text{scFID} = ||\mu_r - \mu_g||^2 + \text{Tr}(\Sigma_r + \Sigma_g - 2(\Sigma_r \Sigma_g)^{1/2})
where \mu and \Sigma are means and covariances of embedded representations.

Advantages:
	•	Uses foundation model embeddings instead of raw gene expression.
	•	Robust to noise, better reflects biological similarity.

C. Reinforcement Learning with GRPO
	•	Applies Group Relative Policy Optimization to improve:
	•	Perturbation response prediction
	•	Nonlinear gene program reasoning

🧠 Biological Capabilities Enabled

1. Cell Type Annotation and Reasoning
	•	Handles annotation, tissue inference, cell interactions, and complex biological QA.

2. Conditioned Cell Generation
	•	Generates cells based on user queries such as:
	•	“CD8+ T cells from pancreas”
	•	“7 human kidney cells”
	•	Allows multi-cell and neighborhood generation, supporting spatial reasoning.

3. Perturbation Response Modeling
	•	Predicts how cells respond to:
	•	Drugs
	•	Cytokines
	•	Gene knockouts
	•	Generalizes across unseen combinations of cell types and perturbations.

🔁 Comparison to Other scFMs (Single-Cell Foundation Models)

Feature	C2S-Scale	Other Models (scGPT, Geneformer, scFoundation)
Data Representation	Text (ordered gene names)	Expression matrix
Architecture	General LLMs (Gemma, Pythia)	Custom architectures
Scale	Up to 27B parameters	Typically ≤ 1B
Multimodal Input	Yes (text + expression + metadata)	Often limited
Tasks Supported	Multi-task incl. QA, generation	Usually single-task
Language Interpretation	Natural language interface	Limited / none
Spatial Modeling	Supports cell neighborhood context	Rarely supported
RL Fine-tuning	GRPO for specific tasks	Not used

🧪 Implementation Notes

A. Cell Sentence Construction
	•	Convert expression matrix → ordered gene names
	•	Preserves expression ranking with minimal loss
	•	Reversible: can map back to expression values

B. Training Tasks
	•	Multi-task format using natural language prompts, such as:
	•	“What tissue is this cell from?”
	•	“Generate a fibroblast in lung after IL-6 stimulation.”

📈 scFID vs. FID — Visual vs. Single-Cell Analogy

Concept	FID (Image)	scFID (Single-Cell)
Data Type	Images	Gene expression
Embedding Source	Inception-v3	scGPT / Foundation model
Goal	Image realism	Biological fidelity
Noise Robustness	High	Very high
Evaluation	Visual realism	Functional relevance

🔎 scFID makes it possible to evaluate single-cell generation not just by expression statistics, but by biologically meaningful features.
