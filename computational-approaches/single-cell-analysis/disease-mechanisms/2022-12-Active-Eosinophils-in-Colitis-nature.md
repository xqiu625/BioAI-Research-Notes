## Personal Notes
### 1. Roles of A-Eos in Intestinal Immunity

#### 1. Dual Protective Functions
A-Eos exhibits two main protective mechanisms:
1. Direct Antimicrobial Activity
2. Immune Response Regulation

#### 1.1 Antimicrobial Functions
##### Evidence from Bacterial Challenges:
- Greater bactericidal activity against C. rodentium compared to:
  - Blood eosinophils (circulating)
  - Spleen eosinophils (B-Eos)
  - Unconditioned BM-Eos

Measured luminescence values indicate bacterial viability
Lower luminescence = higher bactericidal activity

```

##### Molecular Mechanisms:
1. Enhanced Granule Activity:
   - Peripheral distribution of EPX
   - Higher CD63 expression
   - Increased granule mobilization

2. Antimicrobial Programs:
   - Sustained expression of granulogenesis genes
   - Upregulation of antimicrobial peptides
   - Formation of extracellular DNA traps

#### 1.2 Immune Regulatory Functions
##### T Cell Regulation:
1. Direct Effects:
   - Inhibition of CD4‚Å∫ T cell proliferation
   - Expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80/PD-L1)

2. Cytokine Production:
   - IL-16, TNF, IL-1Œ≤
   - CCL3, CXCL2, VEGFA
   - PTGS2
