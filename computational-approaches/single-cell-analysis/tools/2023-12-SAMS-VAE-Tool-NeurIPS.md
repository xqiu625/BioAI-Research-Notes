## ðŸ’¡ Personal Notes

A. What Makes SAMS-VAE Special:
  1. **Additive Embedding Structure:**
- Imagine each cell's representation (zi) as: zi = ziáµ‡ + ziáµ–
- ziáµ‡: base state (natural cell variation)
- ziáµ–: perturbation effects (changes from treatments)
- Like having a "before" and "what changed" picture for each cell
  2. **Sparse Mechanism Shifts:**
- Uses a clever masking system (mt) that identifies which parts of the cell actually change
- Instead of assuming every treatment affects everything, it pinpoints specific changes
- Example: If you add Drug A, maybe only 20% of cell features actually change
  3. **Smart Composition for Multiple Treatments:**
- Can predict what happens when you combine treatments
- Unlike simpler models that treat each combination as brand new
- Example: If you know how Drug A and Drug B work separately, it can predict what happens when you use both

Key Embedding Components:

```
Treatment Effects = Î£ di,t(et âŠ™ mt)
where:
- et: embedding showing how a treatment changes cells
- mt: binary mask showing which parts change
- di,t: whether treatment t was applied
- âŠ™: element-wise multiplication
```

Real-World Example:
- Think of studying cancer treatments
- Traditional: Must test every possible drug combination
- SAMS-VAE: Learn from single drug responses, then predict combinations
- Saves time and resources in drug development

It creates interpretable, composable embeddings that:
1. Show which cell parts are affected (through masks)
2. Can predict combination effects
3. Separate natural cell variation from treatment effects
