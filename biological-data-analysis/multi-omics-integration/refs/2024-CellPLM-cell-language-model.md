## Relevance to Multi-omics Integration
This paper is relevant to multi-omics integration through:
- Integration of transcriptomic and spatial data modalities
  * Combines single-cell RNA sequencing data with spatial location information
  * Leverages spatial transcriptomics data during pre-training
  * Creates unified representations capturing both molecular and spatial features

- Novel Data Integration Approaches:
  * Cell-centric token representation enabling multi-modal data fusion
  * Batch-aware decoder handling data from different experimental conditions
  * Gaussian mixture latent space for better multi-modal distribution modeling

- Multi-modal Applications:
  * Spatial transcriptomics imputation combining expression and location data
  * Integration of batch information with molecular data
  * Joint analysis of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data

## Key Points for Multi-omics Integration
1. Data Integration Strategy:
   - Uses cells as tokens to naturally combine different data modalities
   - Employs batch-aware decoder to handle heterogeneous data sources
   - Utilizes Gaussian mixture model to capture complex multi-modal distributions

2. Integration Challenges Addressed:
   - Batch effect mitigation across different experimental conditions
   - Handling missing data in spatial transcriptomics
   - Combining local and global cellular context

3. Technical Innovations:
   - Novel architecture for multi-modal data fusion
   - Efficient processing of different data types
   - Scalable approach for large-scale multi-omics analysis

## Notable Results in Multi-omics Integration
1. Performance Improvements:
   - Better spatial transcriptomics imputation accuracy
   - Effective integration of batch information
   - Improved cell type annotation using multiple data modalities

2. Integration Benefits:
   - Enhanced biological insight through combined analysis
   - More robust cell type identification
   - Better capture of spatial cellular organization
