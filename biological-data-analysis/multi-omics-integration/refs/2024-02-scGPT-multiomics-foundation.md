## Relevance to Multi-omics Integration
This paper is relevant to multi-omics integration through:
- Novel framework for integrating multiple types of single-cell data
- Unified representation learning across different modalities
- Batch effect correction and data harmonization
- Multi-modal data analysis capabilities

## Key Points for Multi-omics Integration
1. Integration Strategy:
   - Joint learning of cell and gene representations
   - Attention mechanism for cross-modality interactions
   - Batch-aware processing for data harmonization

2. Multi-modal Applications:
   - scRNA-seq batch integration
   - Integration of multiple omics modalities
   - Cross-modality prediction tasks

3. Technical Advantages:
   - Scalable to large multi-modal datasets (33M cells)
   - Flexible adaptation to different data types
   - End-to-end integration framework

## Notable Results in Multi-omics Integration
- Superior performance in batch effect correction
- Effective integration of multi-modal single-cell data
- Improved cell type annotation using integrated data
