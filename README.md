# 📊 Paper Classification Guide

## Primary Categories

### 1. Foundation Models
- **Single-Cell Models**: Large language models for single-cell analysis (e.g., scGPT, CellPLM)
- **Protein Models**: Language models for protein analysis
- **Methodology**: General foundation model approaches (e.g., TIME-LLM)

### 2. Single-Cell Analysis
- **Dynamics and Velocity**: RNA velocity, trajectory inference, cellular dynamics (e.g., scVelo, CellRank2)
- **Disease Mechanisms**: Disease-specific cellular analysis

### 3. Drug Discovery
- **Phenotypic Screening**: High-throughput screening methods
- **Protein Disease Mechanisms**: Studies analyzing disease-causing protein variations and mechanisms
