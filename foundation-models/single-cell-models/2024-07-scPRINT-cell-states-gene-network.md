### A. scPRINT on mouse data:
    1. Processes mouse data through the same pipeline as human data
    2. Successfully benchmarked on mouse embryonic stem cell datasets in the MCalla et al. ground truth evaluations
    3. Uses ESM2 protein embeddings that work across species since proteins are highly conserved between mice and humans

    The model handles mouse genes by:
      - Mapping mouse gene symbols to their protein sequences using Ensembl
      - Converting these into embeddings using ESM2
      - Processing them through the same transformer architecture

    The authors demonstrate this cross-species capability in their benchmarks, showing competitive performance on mouse datasets. This is particularly useful for researchers working with mouse models.

### B. scPRINT's most unique and innovative function:
    1. Cell Type Specificity:
      -  Unlike traditional methods that produce one general network, scPRINT generates networks specific to each cell type or state
      -  Can differentiate between healthy and disease cell states within the same cell type (as shown in their prostate cancer analysis)
      
    2. Implementation Innovation:
      -  Uses a novel "multi-cell attention" mechanism that aggregates information across similar cells
      -  Made computationally efficient enough to handle genome-wide networks (1-100,000 cells) on standard hardware
      -  Can process networks of 2,200 to all expressed genes in a cell
      
    3. Head Selection Method:
      - Introduces a unique way to select relevant attention heads for specific biological contexts
      - Can fine-tune the network generation for different types of interactions (e.g., protein-protein, transcription factor binding)

    4. This functionality is particularly unique because it:
      - Doesn't require additional training (zero-shot)
      - Works across species
      - Scales to genome-wide analysis
      - Maintains biological interpretability
      - Operates on commodity hardware
      
### C. Types of Gene Networks that scPRINT can infer:
      -Gene-to-Gene Interactions
      -Transcription Factor (TF) to Gene relationships
      -Cell type-specific networks
      -Disease-state specific networks
