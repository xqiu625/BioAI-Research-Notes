ðŸ’¡ Personal Notes
A. Cd-hit:
  1. Training Dataset Preparation:
- They used Cd-hit to cluster RNA sequences at 80% sequence similarity threshold
- Starting with 5,583 RNA chains from PDB
- After clustering with Cd-hit, obtained 782 unique sequence clusters
- Purpose: To create a non-redundant training dataset

2. RNA-FM Language Model Training Data:
- Used Cd-hit-est (the nucleotide version of Cd-hit)
- Applied 100% similarity threshold
- Purpose: Remove exact duplicates from RNAcentral sequences while preserving as many unique sequences as possible
- Resulted in ~23.7 million ncRNA sequences for pretraining

The specific command appears to be:
```bash
cd-hit-est -c 1.0  # For 100% similarity threshold in RNA-FM data
cd-hit -c 0.8      # For 80% similarity threshold in training data
```

This usage of Cd-hit serves two key purposes:
1. Prevents data leakage between training and testing sets
2. Reduces training bias from overrepresented sequence families
3. Ensures the model learns from diverse RNA sequences rather than redundant ones

The different thresholds (80% vs 100%) reflect different needs:
- Stricter threshold (80%) for training data to ensure truly distinct examples
- More permissive threshold (100%) for language model pretraining to maintain large dataset size while removing only exact duplicates
