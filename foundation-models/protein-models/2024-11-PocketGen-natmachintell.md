* Explain the bilevel graph transformer
The bilevel graph transformer is a key architectural innovation in PocketGen designed to model complex protein-ligand interactions at multiple scales.

Key Concept:
The model represents the protein-ligand complex as a geometric graph of blocks (sets of atoms), allowing it to handle varying numbers of atoms across different residues and ligands.

Structure:
1. Block Representation
  - Each residue or ligand is treated as a block containing multiple atoms
  - Each block has:
    - Feature matrix Hi ‚àà ‚Ñùni√ódh (atom features)
    - Coordinate matrix Xi ‚àà ‚Ñùni√ó3 (3D coordinates)
    - ni represents number of atoms in the block
    - dh is the feature dimension

2. Attention Mechanisms The transformer operates at two levels simultaneously:
a) Atom-level Attention
  - Captures detailed interactions between individual atoms
  - Computes attention weights Œ±ij between atoms in different blocks
  - Uses distance and coordinate information
  - Formula: Rij = (1/‚àödr)(QiKj^T) + œÉD(RBF(Dij))
  - Sparse attention is used to focus on most relevant interactions

b) Residue/Ligand-level Attention
  - Models higher-level interactions between entire residues or ligands
  - Aggregates atom-level interactions to block level
  - Uses Œ≤ij attention weights between blocks
  - Formula: rij = (1^T Rij 1)/(ninj)

3. The model updates both:
  - Atom features (Hi)
  - 3D coordinates (Xi)
  - Only updates coordinates for pocket residues and ligand, keeping other protein parts fixed

Key Features:
1. E(3) Equivariance
  - Maintains geometric consistency under rotations and translations
  - Critical for handling 3D molecular structures
2. Multi-scale Processing
  - Simultaneously processes atomic and residue-level information
  - Helps capture both local and global interaction patterns
3. Flexible Architecture
  - Can handle varying numbers of atoms
  - Adaptable to different types of residues and ligands
